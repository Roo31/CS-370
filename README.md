The section I had to code for this assignment was the Q-Training section. There was pseduocode to set up the logic to follow. 
Computer scientists are the brains behind a lot of the tech and software we use every day. They work on a wide range of projects, from creating apps that make our lives easier to developing complex algorithms that help solve critical issues like climate change or improve healthcare. Their role is crucial because they push the boundaries of what technology can do, helping streamline old processes and invent new ways to tackle problems. Whether they're optimizing route planning in real-time maps or enhancing security measures to protect data, the work of computer scientists impacts nearly every aspect of modern life, making technology smarter, faster, and more efficient.
When tackling a problem, computer scientists use a methodical approach: they start by breaking down the problem to understand it better, then brainstorm potential solutions, and finally, create algorithms to execute these solutions effectively. This process is very much like what we see in AI pathfinding, where the goal is to program a smart agent that can find its way through a maze as efficiently as possible. Ethically, computer scientists have a responsibility to ensure their creations are safe and fair for everyone. This means they need to think about how their technology might affect users and the wider community, striving to protect personal data, prevent biases in AI, and make sure their technologies are transparent and accountable. This ethical mindfulness helps ensure that advancements in tech improve our lives without compromising our values or safety.
